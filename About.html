      I'm Muhammad Ameen: A Passionate Learner of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
      <br />

      I'm Muhammad Ameen, a young and ambitious individual who is currently
      learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br />
      Despite my busy schedule as a full-time student, I've made it a priority <br>
      to learn these essential web development technologies in my free time. I <br> 
      first became interested in frontend development when I saw the power of <br>
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing <br>
      websites. I was fascinated by the creative process of designing and <br>
      building user interfaces, and the satisfaction of seeing my work come to <br>
      life in the browser. To further my skills and knowledge, I've dedicated <br>
      myself to learning as much as I can about these technologies. I spend <br>
      hours each day working on coding exercises and building small projects, <br>
      always striving to improve and push myself further. In addition to HTML, <br>
      CSS, and JavaScript, I've also learned the basics of React.js and gained <br>
      experience with version control using Git and GitHub. My dedication and <br>
      hard work have not gone unnoticed. My peers and teachers have recognized <br>
      my talent and potential, and I've received recognition for my skills and <br>
      achievements. I'm excited to see where my journey with web development <br>
      will take me in the future. I'm confident that with hard work and <br>
      dedication, I can achieve my goals and turn my passion for frontend <br>
      development into a successful career. <br>
